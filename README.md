## Description

A fun maze generator and solver written in python. This project is a good visual representation of the depth-first search algortihm which is used both to generate the maze, then once again to solve it. 

### Prerequisites 🚀

The only Prerequisites is to have python3 and tkinter installed. I am specifically running Python 3.10.12 and tkinter 8.6.

* python version
   ```sh
    python3 --version  
    Python 3.10.12
    python3 -m tkinter

## Usage

To use the script from the terminal, just run ./main.sh. This runs the main function that will generate and solve a random maze. You can modify the main.py file to adjust the number of rows and columns the maze should have. You can also adjust the seed value if you want the maze to generate the same way more than once. 

* run tests
  ```sh
  ./test.sh
  ...
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 3 tests in 0.001s
  OK

* execute script
   ```sh
   ./main.sh
   maze created in 9.80674409866333s
   maze solved! in 4.411366939544678s
